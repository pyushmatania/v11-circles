- `npm run test` – run unit tests with Vitest

# Circles: Ultra-Detailed DevOps Copilot Optimization

## 🧠 Circles Optimization + Code Quality Audit

This project uses a world-class optimization and audit workflow:

- **No unused or duplicate files/components**
- **All code is performant, clean, and modular**
- **All UI/animation/visuals are preserved**
- **All scrolling and transitions are buttery smooth**
- **All features work as intended on all screen sizes**

### 🛠️ Automated Build Optimizations

- **Manual chunking** for React, animation, UI, admin, and project code
- **CSS code splitting** and optimized asset naming
- **Console/debugger removal** in production
- **Modern browser targeting**
- **Pre-bundling and dependency optimization**
- **Brotli and gzip compression** for production builds
- **Bundle analyzer** for visualizing and optimizing bundle size

### 🚀 How to Use

1. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate compressed `.br` and `.gz` assets in `dist/`.

2. **Analyze the bundle:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   # Then open dist/bundle-analysis.html in your browser
   ```
   The analyzer will show a visual breakdown of your bundle.

3. **Audit/optimize:**
   - Run `npm run lint` for code quality
   - Use the audit prompt in this README to guide further improvements

## Golden Rule

> **Do NOT downgrade or remove any of the following:**
> Gradients, Poster quality, Canvas/3D effects, Glitch text, Floating orbs, Confetti, cube effects, animated numbers, Typewriter effects, Dark/light themes

The goal is to **optimize, not sterilize.**
